        <p><i>Sept 2021</i></p>
        <p>Many other people have written better and wiser guides for applying to the NSF GRFP (<a href="http://www.malloryladd.com/nsf-grfp-advice.html" target="_blank">Mallory Ladd</a> and <a href="https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship" target="_blank">Alex Lang</a> have very good guides/resources on the GRFP), the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program. But a few folks have reached out and asked me about applying, so I'm writing down here some tips that I find myself repeating and that I didn't necessarily find online but via the experience of applying. Unfortunately, these are just based off of my own experience but hopefully it is helpful for anyone reading?</p>
        <p>Some background: I received the 2020 Award in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering division; I applied in 2019 during the first quarter of my PhD program (in other words, my application was in the first year PhD student pool).</p>

      <b>general comments</b>
        <ul class="arrow">
          <li>The first thing is to <b>carefully read the ENTIRE fellowship program solicitation</b>, whatever latest version is applicable. There are a lot of requirements in the application process, and you must be aware of all of them + some change in small but important ways.</li>
          <li>Also, read the advice on <a href="http://www.malloryladd.com/nsf-grfp-advice.html" target="_blank">Mallory Ladd</a> and <a href="https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship" target="_blank">Alex Lang</a>'s sites. They provide much more thorough advice than anything I list here and are The Sites to go to. They also archive successful apps, which is very helpful.</li>
          <li>It might seem like overkill, but it is really important/helpful to <b>start working on the application the summer before the deadline you plan to apply to, particularly for the research statement</b>. I started drafting up research ideas early in the summer, making drafts of the research statement that I continuously revised (I had at least 10 different saved iterations of both the research and personal statements by the time I applied). I hadn't started my program yet but started working with my advisor and research groupmates, who were kind enough to start mentoring me and give me feedback on things before my official start. </li>
          <li>Something that made my statements dramatically better was that I <b>asked a lot of different people for feedback, as appropriate, and iterated through many versions to refine the statements</b>. Obviously you don't want to bother someone to read your draft every week, but it's important to get feedback throughout this process (even if it feels intimidating). My general strategy was to get feedback from my advisor at kind of critical points throughout the drafting and then get feedback in the in-between from more senior PhD students (mostly from my research group). Some research group members gave me really in-depth feedback which was immensely helpful. For a little bit I also did swaps each week with another student in my program who was applying. I even asked my family to read it to see if it made sense.</li>
          <li>I think there is a tendency for people to focus on refining the Intellectual Merit part of the research and personal statements (e.g. coming up with a solid research plan and demonstrating you have the skills to do it), but the Broader Impacts section is also very important. I think mine was not particularly strong, and if I were to write my application again I would try to write the broader impacts more clearly and compellingly. Others have more advice on how to structure and write the Broader Impacts sections.</li>
        </ul>

      <b>research statement</b>
        <ul class="arrow">
          <li>Early on I <b>read the research statements of successful applications that were on topics similar to mine</b>. I found these in two ways: (1) on the NSF GRFP pages of <a href="http://www.malloryladd.com/nsf-grfp-advice.html" target="_blank">Mallory Ladd</a> and <a href="https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship" target="_blank">Alex Lang</a>'s sites; (2) from people in my research group and my program who were willing to share their successful apps + I reached out to. While reading successful research proposal statements, I noted what made their structure effective, how they made their research goals clear, etc. I even modeled my structure after one that fit well with what I was doing.</li>
          <li> The research statements are short, so it's important to ask yourself while editing: What is the purpose of each paragraph? How does each sentence build up to that purpose? And then cut out the useless bits or make clarifications accordingly. I once read an New York Times Op-Ed by Viet Thanh Nguyen and was struck by how well-crafted it was &mdash; not a single word that didn't have to be there! That is the vibe we are going for. This is something that also helps for good writing in general + applies to the personal statement too.</li>
          <li>Similarly, you want to <b>use your citations in the research statement strategically</b>. There's space to cite maybe 4 pieces in your research statement. Consider what group of researchers you want to appeal to (that is, the research community who will *get* it), because citations are in a sense a signal for assigning reviewers.</li>
        </ul>

      <b>personal statement</b>
        <ul class="arrow">
          <li>I also read personal statements of the apps I looked at. This is a little less helpful because the <b>NSF GRFP is about funding you as a person</b> (so it makes less sense to try to model after others' personal statements; also your background and experiences will generally differ quite a bit from previous applicants), but still serves as a general benchmark for how to effectively structure the thing. What I actually did was adapt my graduate school applications for my GRFP personal statement (it got me into grad school, after all c:).</li>
          <li>An fellowship advisor in the Office of Fellowships at my institution read an earlier version of my personal statement and mentioned it was very boring (grad school app personal statements are kind of dry sometimes, and mine was on the drier end; I don't like writing down personal things for applications, for whatever reason, so it was a bit of struggle!). I tried to make it less so by shifting towards some more personal things that had motivated my academic interests and things I care about doing with/through my work.</li>
