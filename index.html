        <p>My name is Sohyeon Hwang, and I'm a first-year PhD student in the Media, Technology, and Society program at Northwestern University. I am advised by <a href="http://www.aaronshaw.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Aaron Shaw</a> and part of the <a href="https://communitydata.science/" target="_blank">Community Data Science Collective</a>.</p>
        <p>My research interests center around governance (broadly speaking) and online participation. I currently focus on the complexity of governance in large-scale platforms, particularly platforms that follow decentralized modes of moderation and rule enforcement, like Reddit and Wikipedia. In the long-term, I'm interested in how heterogeniety in sociotechnical features come together to disparately govern and affect diverse groups on these large-scale platforms. More broadly, I am interested in how ideas (e.g. about governance) evolve in propagation across these kinds of large-scale social computing systems.</p>
        <p>Before I came to Northwestern, I received my B.A. from Cornell University, double-majoring in Government and Information Science. Afterwards I was an <a href="https://www.emmabowenfoundation.com/sohyeon_hwang" target="_blank">Emma Bowen Summer Fellow</a> on the Audience Team at Reveal/Center for Investigative Reporting. The work there gave me a final push to apply to grad school :^)</p>
        <p>You can find the PDF of my CV <a href="/docs/sohw_cv_aug2019.pdf">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I spend a lot of time napping, hanging around museums, and taking pictures on my point-and-shoot. I enjoy simple things and so I am trying to keep my site simple as well.</p>

            <p>This project aims to develop an understanding of "complexity" of governance in large-scale social computing systems. Although many sites have platform-wide rules, governance in practice is culturally and socially contingent. Sub-communities often demonstrate clashing interpretations of rule meanings, such as what counts as harassment of a minority group. Using trace data of governance-related activity on two platforms with decentralized modes of governance, Wikipedia and Reddit, we map and evaluate how communities heterogeneously fill the gap between rules-as-written (de jure) and rules-as-practiced (de facto) to impact the credibility and effectiveness of online governance.</p>
            <p>In ongoing and future work I aim to map the range of governance <i>de jure</i> in written rules across sub-communities of online platforms as well as the range of governance <i>de facto</i> in the enforcement practices and tools, to develop a model of the complex ecosystem of digital governance and understand the impact of this complex hetergeneity on the effectiveness of governing online communities.
