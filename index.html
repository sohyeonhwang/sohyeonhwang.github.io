        <img src="/imgs/sohw.jpg" alt="a pic of me my sister took" id="user-pic"/>
        <p>My name is Sohyeon Hwang, and I'm a first-year PhD student in the Media, Technology, and Society program at Northwestern University. I am advised by <a href="http://www.aaronshaw.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Aaron Shaw</a> and part of the <a href="https://communitydata.science/" target="_blank">Community Data Science Collective</a>. </p>
        <p>My research interests center around governance (broadly speaking) and online participation. I currently focus on the complexity of governance in large-scale social computing systems, particularly networked platforms that follow decentralized modes of moderation and rule enforcement, like Reddit and Wikipedia. You can scroll down to see my current projects.</p>
        <p>In the long-term, I'm interested in how heterogeneous socio-technical features come together to disparately govern and affect diverse groups on large-scale, networked platforms. More broadly, I am interested in how ideas (e.g. about governance) and user-generated content evolve in propagation across these kinds of systems/platforms, which are also connected to one another in complicated ways.</p>
        <p>Before I came to Northwestern, I received my B.A. from Cornell University, double-majoring in Government and Information Science. Afterwards I was an <a href="https://www.emmabowenfoundation.com/sohyeon_hwang" target="_blank">Emma Bowen Summer Fellow</a> on the Audience Team at Reveal/Center for Investigative Reporting. The work there gave me a final push to apply to grad school :^)</p>
        <p>In my non-academic life, I volunteer as a tutor with the cool folks at <a href="https://www.girlforward.org/what-we-do" target="_blank">GirlForward</a> and like to nap, hang around museums, and take pictures on my point-and-shoot.</p>

        <h3 onclick="myFunction('proj1')">> complex governance</h3>
        <div id="proj1" class="w3-hide w3-container">
            <p>This project aims to develop an understanding of "complexity" of governance in large-scale social computing systems. Although many sites have platform-wide rules, governance in practice is culturally and socially contingent. Sub-communities often demonstrate clashing interpretations of rule meanings, such as what counts as harassment of a minority group. Using trace data of governance-related activity on two platforms with decentralized modes of governance, Wikipedia and Reddit, we map and evaluate how communities heterogeneously fill the gap between rules-as-written (de jure) and rules-as-practiced (de facto) to impact the credibility and effectiveness of online governance.</p>
            <p>In ongoing and future work I aim to map the range of governance <i>de jure</i> in written rules across sub-communities of online platforms as well as the range of governance <i>de facto</i> in the enforcement practices and tools, to develop a model of the complex ecosystem of digital governance and understand the impact of this complex hetergeneity on the effectiveness of governing online communities.
